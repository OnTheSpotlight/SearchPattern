November is called the “month of thanksgiving” leading up to Thanksgiving Day. I try to appreciate all of our good fortunes as much as possible, but the last couple of days that we spent without heat has given me a new perspective on what it really means to count our blessings.

It was the night before Thanksgiving when we realized that our furnace had stopped working. The kids were already asleep, and my wife and I were heading to bed. The temperature in the house had already been dropping, but it was still tolerable. It was too late to call about the furnace, and we knew that most places would be closed during Thanksgiving. We needed to just tough it out for a day, and then try to get someone here on Friday.

By Thursday morning, it was so cold in the house that the chill in the air was palpable. When I moved my arms, or walked through a room the cold air pressed against my body. When our Thanksgiving lunch was ready, the words “Lunch is ready, come eat before the food gets cold,” carried a deeper meaning.

The thing was that without heat everything was cold. Our dishes, our clothes, the floors, and the towels in the bathroom. Whatever we did, we couldn’t escape it.

By Thursday night, the temperature in our house had dropped lower. I did everything I could to stay warm. I put on my heavy winter coat before I climbed into bed, just so that I would have that extra layer. The coat and blankets all offered insulation, but never really made me feel warmer. I think that by that point, my main goal was to avoid feeling any colder than I did at that point.

At eight o’clock Friday morning, I called a second service and made arrangements for a service call. Our furnace was working and heat was restored in our house by lunch time.

I’ve learned a couple of things from this experience. First, I don’t know if we can ever be thankful enough for what we have--whether it is a solid job, heat, good health, or supportive family. Sometimes, it is easy for me to focus on the things that I lack and overlook our blessings. Second, I took the heat in our house for granted until it was no longer available. I’m sure there are other aspects of my life that I take for granted, and I’ll be thinking a little more about how I can try to appreciate them more. Third, how scary it is lose something that is so important to you, and then how important it starts to feel to either get that something back, or stop things from getting worse.
